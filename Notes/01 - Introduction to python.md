To work with python, we first need to install a couple of programs. For the purposes of this course, we will use VS Code as our code editor.

# Setup

## Install python

Download python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After the installer is done, you can verify your installation using the following command in the command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

Python by default comes with a package manager called `pip`. To verify this has been installed, use the following command:
```bash
pip --version
```

Once this has been done, your python environment is set up.

## Install VS Code

The IDE or code editor we'll be using for this course is Visual Studio Code. (Visual studio code is a lightweight code editor. For more heavy usage it's recommended to use something like [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/))

To start, download VS Code from the following link: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

To be able to use python, we have to install a few extensions.
- Open VS Code and navigate to the extensions tab.
- Search for Python in the search bar
    - Install the Python Extension
    - Install the Python Debugger Extension
